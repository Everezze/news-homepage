## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow

Building from mobile as it will require the less amount of code to adapt it to
desktop, except for the navigation bar where I started from desktop and shrink
it to find a good breakpoint.

### Continued development
Trying to have a solution for vertically aligning elements as the siblings next
to it grow or shrink without modern layout solutions, maybe tables?
